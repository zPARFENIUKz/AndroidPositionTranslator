Fake where your phone is located (Mock location for Android).

Sometimes you need to fake the location of your device (for privacy or to test an app). Fake Traveler provides you a map to select the location where you want your phone to be.

## How does it work?

Long press in the map where you want to be located or type the latitude and longitude, and tap the Apply button. Tapping the "..." button you will be shown two settings to mock the location over a period of time.

## Requirements?

In order to work, you need to allow Fake Traveler to mock locations. You have to [enable Developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options?hl=en-419) and select this app in "Settings/System/Developer options/Select mock location app" option.
